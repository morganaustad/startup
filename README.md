# Virtual Feature Suggestion Box

[My Notes](notes.md)

A web app designed for various individuals to send feature suggestions to one individual or company for review. (Possible addition of others being able to see suggested features and have the ability to upvote them.)

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
> Startup README.md [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

During the development of software or video games, user feedback is remarkably important. This web app is designed to compile suggestions, and bugs found, from users for developers and designers to use in their development process. It will also offer an opportunity for users to see other suggestions and vote for those to be added, which will help decrease the number of submissions and allow the developers to see the most desired feature.

### Design

Having a login option will allow the person seeking suggestions to limit who can enter and suggest features. Once past the login stage, the individual may suggest a feature or vote on already suggested features. Features with the most votes will be at the top.

### Key features

- List of suggested features by users
- Ability to vote on liked features for host to see preferences
- Login capabilities

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Will use two HTML pages for structure of content. One page for login and another for suggesting features and voting.
- **CSS** - Styling the application with reasonable color tones and spacing.
- **React** - Login, suggesting features and updating what is shown, voting for features and showing the changes.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - retrieving suggested features
    - submitting suggested feature
    - retrieving vote counts
    - Register, login, and logout users. Cannot suggest features without being registered.
- **DB/Login** - Stores login information and data, users, votes, and suggestions.
- **WebSocket** - As suggestions are submitted and votes are casted, that is broadcast to other users.
